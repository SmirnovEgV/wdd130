    <h2>Egor Smirnov</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Egor Smirnov. I live in Minsk, Belarus (Eastern Europe) and was a member of the Chrurch for my whole life. My major is applied tech with emphasis on backend and DB. </p>
    <p>As of hobbies, I like to play games, watch anime, fix random things and visit random places and countries by car.
    </p>
    <p>I like that BYUI provides opportunity to study from home. It's really convinient and beneficial though doesen't work for every decree. I took this cource because it was required for backend certification. </p>
