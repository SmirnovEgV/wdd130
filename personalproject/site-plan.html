    <h3>Orders</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure that all firearms are sold and purchased legally and safely, we strictly adhere to the legal
      requirements set forth by the legislation of the United States. As a potential buyer, it is important to
      understand and comply with these requirements
      before making a purchase.
      <br> <br> First and foremost, all buyers must be over the age of 18 and provide a valid identification document.
      This is to ensure that firearms are not sold to minors who are not yet legally allowed to possess them. In
      addition to this, buyers
      are required to provide a permit to purchase a firearm which is issued by government agencies or the police. This
      permit serves as a verification of the buyer's eligibility to purchase a firearm and is a crucial step in ensuring
      the safety
      of both the buyer and the community.
      <br> <br> Please note that we do not deliver firearms to states where there are restrictions on the purchase and
      ownership of firearms. It is the responsibility of the buyer to ensure that they are eligible to purchase and
      possess a firearm
      in their state of residence. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our requirements and restrictions,
      please feel free to contact us for more detailed information. We are committed to providing a safe and legal
      process for purchasing
      firearms and are always happy to assist our customers in any way possible.
